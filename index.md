## Allons-y!

Hi I'm Manuel Dileo and I'm a PhD student at Connets Lab, University of Milan. My research interests lies in the intersection between machine learning on graphs and network science. I'm currently working on temporal graph learning and temporal knowledge graphs. Enemies to lovers story with Python. I'm a former [Google Developer Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) lead.

### News
I'm a visiting PGR student at the Informatics Forum of the University of Edinburgh for Summer 2023. Feel free to reach me if you want to discuss about temporal networks and temporal graph learning :)
