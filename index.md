## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hi I'm Manuel Dileo and I'm a research assistant at Connets Lab, University of Milan. My research interests include network analysis and machine learning on graphs, especially graph neural networks applied to every kind of learning task on complex systems. Enemies to lovers story with Python. I'm a former [Google Developer Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) lead.

### Conference talks
- The impact of textual content on link prediction in online social networks @ [CompleNet2022](https://complenet.weebly.com/)

### Projects
