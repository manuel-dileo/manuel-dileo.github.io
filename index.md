## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hi I'm Manuel Dileo and I'm a computer science student from the University of Milan. I'm data science enthusiast and my interests include machine learning, data gathering on web using web scraping or social media API, network science and social media analysis, data driven induction of fuzzy sets. I'm obviously a python lover and I enjoy reading about software design and mathematical models. I'm currently a core-team member of [Google Developer Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) where I'm data science speaker.
