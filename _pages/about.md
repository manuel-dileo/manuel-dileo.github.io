Talks
======
- [Tensor Decomposition for TKG reasoning: from completion to forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6VZkSTD6IQ): Talk about tensor decomposition techniques for TKG reasoning held for the [Temporal Graph Learning reading group](https://shenyanghuang.github.io/rg.html).
- [Demystifying Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/manuel-dileo/intro-gnn/blob/main/musemi/musemi_demystifying_gnns.pdf): General talk about how GNNs work, when they are successful, and when they can fail, as GNNs do not represent the state-of-the-art for any kind of graphML task. 
- [Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/manuel-dileo/intro-gnn): Teaching material for machine learning on graphs' lectures and lab. sessions held for various seminars, master degree and PhD courses on graphML. [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbUjLRt3CHU) of a seminar on GNNs is available for those who understand italian.
