Hi I'm Manuel Dileo and I'm a PhD student at [Connets Lab](https://www.connets.di.unimi.it), University of Milan. My research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning on graphs and network science. I'm currently working on temporal graph learning and temporal knowledge graphs. Enemies to Lovers story with Python. I'm a former visiting researcher at the University of Edinburgh and [Google Developer Student Club](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) lead.

Seminars and Workshops
======
- [Demystifying Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/manuel-dileo/intro-gnn/blob/main/musemi/musemi_demystifying_gnns.pdf): General talk about how GNNs work, when they are successful, and when they can fail, as GNNs do not represent the state-of-the-art for any kind of graphML task. 
- [Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/manuel-dileo/intro-gnn): Teaching material for machine learning on graphs' lectures and lab. sessions held for various seminars, master degree and PhD courses on graphML. [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbUjLRt3CHU) of a seminar on GNNs is available for those who understand italian.
